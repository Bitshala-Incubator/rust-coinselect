# Development Guide

This guide will help you understand the technical scope of this library, and how to contribute.

## Problem Statement

Coin selection is the operation of selecting a subset of UTXOs from the wallet's UTXO set for transaction building. It is a fundamental and generic wallet management operation, and a standalone Rust library would be useful for various downstream wallet projects.

Coin selection is a variant of the Subset-Sum problem and can be solved via various algorithms. Finding an optimized solution depends on various conflicting goals such as confirmation urgency, privacy, UTXO footprint management, etc.

## Background

The following literature describes the current state of coin selection in the Bitcoin ecosystem:

- Murch's coin selection thesis: [PDF](https://murch.one/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf)
- A Survey on Coin Selection Algorithms in UTXO-based Blockchains: [PDF](./docs/coinselectionpdf)
- Bitcoin Core's Coin selection module: [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp)
- Bcoin's Coin selector: [GitHub](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin/blob/master/lib/wallet/coinselector.js)
- A rough implementation of the Lowest Larger Algorithm: [GitHub](https://github.com/Bitshala-Incubator/silent-pay/blob/main/packages/wallet/src/coin-selector.ts)
